# Dotfiles

This repository contains the dotfiles I use on my linux machine. It's
managed via [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io) and is tailored to my personal
preferences.

## Components

### Nushell

For my shell, I use [Nushell][https://www.nushell.sh] due to it's syntax
and emphasis on a functional style of scripting.

### NvChad

I'm a Nvim user and use it when developing. To reduce the amount of customization
I have to do, I use the [NvChad](https://nvchad.com) configuration. In my opinion,
the emphasis on keeping performance high and the usage of Lua makes it a wonderful
way to customize Nvim.
